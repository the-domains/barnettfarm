The Next Chapter

My passion for all things chocolate began at aged 12\. The normal education system did not work for me,

my dyslexia and dyspraxia meant I struggled with various aspects of academia, so my mother decided home schooling would be a better option. Around this time I became fascinated with cacao and its many qualities, tastes and flavours. By aged 13, I was the youngest ever supplier to Waitrose. My professional chocolate and pastry training resulted in me successfully trading chocolate to Selfridges and Sainsburys, with a place given to me as

A World Chocolate Ambassador, in 2011 at the age of 19\. I experienced fame in the confectionery industry at a very young age, and I learnt a good many lessons from all my experiences, some good, some bad, but none I would change.

After 10 years of creating a flourishing career which included creating my own successful chocolate company, my heart was telling me it was time for a change, a new direction and path to follow. I had exceeded all I had ever dreamt of within various business avenues, from marketing, to conservation, to the food and beverage industry and I knew it was time for a new life. A more relaxed basic way of living, with exciting new prospects and ideas. I wanted a completely self sufficient existence. My creative juices were flowing and I was excited for what the future had in store for me.

My love for Mexico began in 2010, after being invited over to the picturesque and mysterious country as a celebrity guest chocolatier. As soon as my feet touched the warm, dry ground, I felt a familiarity; I was home. I have travelled back and forth to this charming and welcoming land many times since, immersing myself in its beautiful culture, and meeting some life long friends.

Earlier this year, I took a step back. I realized that I wanted my life to take a different turn, I wanted a new adventure, and I wanted it to start in Mexico.

I wanted my place to be at the beginning of food production, the start of the line, from the tiny seeds in the ground, which grow into beautiful orchards and plantations, to supplying tables of various restaurants, with a passion for quality from our sustainable source. I want to learn how to make it all grow and more importantly flourish. My passion for agriculture would only be satisfied if I donned my sombrero and shorts and got my hands dirty, and after a lengthy discussion with loved ones, I explained that this was my path and I would return to Mexico for a new life, and that I would love them to be a part of It all.

My parents had often talked about a life under the sun, enjoying their days tending to their animals, indulging in a new culture, with a slower more satisfying pace of life. After a lifetime in the UK working long hours, they wanted a new experience, to explore their creative sides more and to have more time to enjoy their days.

I talked excitedly and constantly about my plans, my dreams, and my aspirations. They could see just how serious I was, and they knew that nothing would stop me, when I want something, I will strive to achieve it. More importantly, I wanted them to be a part of it.

They took a bit of persuading, but after spending a large amount of time researching and talking to countless expatraites who have successfully relocated, and realizing just how content they were with their new lives, my parents soon realized that this would be one of the best, most fulfilling decisions they will ever make.

Everything started falling into place and the dream started shaping into a reality.

As the family home was redecorated, and the "For Sale' sign placed, I felt an air of excitement as the day arrived when the house was finally listed. This would be the start of the next chapter, which we were all more than ready for.

Now we wait for the right buyer, and we are all set to go.

Our new life will start when we land in Merida, in the southern Mexican state of Yucatan.

Here we will rent a property temporarily until we find the perfect area of land, a substantial area with a minimum of 100 acres, with plenty of ideas to fill it.

With limited Spanish between us for now, and little knowledge of construction, permaculture and farming livestock, this will be a test of will and strength, with every single moment being a lesson. We will have to learn quickly and efficiently to ensure that the cabanas and the farm are constructed to start creating an income source for us as soon as possible. We need to create an idyllic environment for visitors to come and stay with us from bare ground; a self sufficient haven, where people can come and relax, or muck in on the farm if they wish. There will be times of tears, stress and questioning as we venture into the unknown, but that is all part of the journey of life, and indeed what makes it such an exciting adventure.

We have two main aims with our dream project -- to create our self-sufficient homes from sustainable materials, built with the help of builders from the local community, with inspiration for the structures taken from the beautiful Earth ship creations. We want them to almost blend into their environment, with a feel that they have grown rather than have been constructed.

One area of our family home will be underground, with a natural cooling element that will help escape the intense midday Mexican sun.

My second area of focus will involve my creative culinary flair. I have visions of creating an eco system where various fruits, vegetables, spices and herbs will grow and thrive side by side. Not forgetting our beautiful menagerie including goats, chickens, cows and birds. 

The crops created from our soil will be 100% organic, no spraying of any kind, just high density, natural ingredients, with a variation of fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices, with of course, Cacao being a top priority produce.

On the farm, close to where it is grown will be a large kitchen space, where some of the magic will be created, and products will be fused together and created to be exported to the range of hotels and restaurants I have an established relationship with.

I have a dream of purchasing and converting a food truck to show the Mexicans just how delicious real British cuisine is. I also what to show them how our recipes can be fused with theirs to create something quite unique and tasty, inspired from two very diverse cultures.

Currently we reside in the beautiful rural village of Kinver, Staffordshire, affectionately known as Hobbit country, where J R Tolkien was inspired to create Hobbiton. My grandmother is the last living person to be born in one of the hobbit houses here, so I feel that as part of my heritage, I have been inspired to recreate part of the magic of these unique dwellings our new homes.

These are animated and challenging times for me and my family, who have remained undaunted at the prospect of giving up everything they have ever known to come and help me fulfill my dreams in a unknown and promising new home. Some people think we are crazy for doing this, but what is life if sometimes you don't plunge yourself headfirst into the unknown and take a chance? I am excited for the flow of magic and creativity that this adventure will bring for all of us, and the stories we will be able to tell and share.
